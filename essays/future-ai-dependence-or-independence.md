### I. Introduction
I believe that artificial intelligence has an enormous potential to enhance the learning and teaching process in the world of academia. This past semester, I had the chance to experience the assistance of the well-known large language model ChatGPT in my software engineering class at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. The experience in itself has shown me the abundance of utility that this technology offers from idea generation to the decomposition of complex topics and its potential to go even further.

### II. Personal Experience with AI:
I have used AI in class this semester in the following areas:

1. Experience WODs e.g. E18

Throughout the many required experiences endured for ICS 314, I did not use artificial intelligence to much extent. I found myself watching the screencast and following instructions provided with each experience more than I did use ChatGPT or any other AI primarily because I found the instructions very detailed and clear in what I needed to do. It was very rare that I did find myself seeking assistance from AI for the experiences of this course, and it would most likely be troubleshooting why my program does not work despite following the screencast step by step.

2. In-class Pratice WODs

Although in-class practice WODs do not hold much pressure compared to actual WODs, I did find the use of ChatGPT very helpful in the moments I was stuck on syntax error and program structure complications. The lack of pressure to succeed in these practice WODs allowed me to truly focus on understanding what was really going on and really allocated time to explore how to utilize AI to my full advantage when developing a program.

5. Final Project

6. Learning a concept/tutorial

7. Answering a question in class or in Discord

8. Asking or answering a smart-question

9. Coding example e.g. "give an example of using underscore.pluck"

10. Explaining code

11. Writing Code

12. Documenting code

13. Quality assurance

14. Other uses in ICS314 not listed above



### III. Impact on Learning and Understanding:
Although not entirely perfect yet, I firmly believe that AI truly has massive potential to enhance the education process and even the workforce on an exponential scale overtime as the larger language models are made available. The capabilities of AI now such as educating a user on certain topics to a very detailed extent are unlike any technology we’ve seen before and it will only continue to grow.

### IV. Practical Applications:
ChatGPT is very useful in practical applications as it is overall very knowledgeable on both topics inside and out of the scope of software engineering. AI provides very informative responses as well as multiple examples of applications pertaining to the topic in question.

### V. Challenges and Opportunities:
Some challenges I faced while using ChatGPT for this class was that sometimes I presented a question regarding a certain part of code that was nested inside a very complex application. This made it often very hard to achieve the results I was looking for, maybe it was in the way I had worded my question that led me to fail in getting the response I had hoped for but I am hopeful that with better trained language models in the future, this problem won’t be as common as it is now.

### VI. Comparative Analysis:
I feel that AI has an advantage over traditional teaching methods for a few reasons. The first being that in this day and age of technology, the younger generation heavily relies on technology more so now than ever. Don’t know a recipe? Google it. Need to figure out how much to tip when eating out? Use the calculator on your phone. Don’t know the syntax for a function of your program? Ask ChatGPT. The second reason is that I personally find responses from AIs like ChatGPT very informative and easy to comprehend.

### VII. Future Considerations:
I think that AI has a very bright future in the world of software engineering, after all it is software itself. I think if used right, with the necessary language models that it can be utilized in a way that provides the most efficiency and consumes less resources than the traditional workforce.

### VIII. Conclusion:
I think that AI should be continuously incorporated into the software engineering course and maybe even other complex courses. Although with the power and knowledge AI has, I believe that it can also do more harm than good, an example of this would be the over reliance on AI to perform simple tasks such as a hello world print statement for code. I believe that the relationship between humans and AIs are similar to a symbiotic relationship in nature, where one is somewhat equally dependent on the other. I recommend to future students of ICS 314 and users of AI to not completely depend on the software all the time, but actually put in the work and effort to troubleshoot or attempt to understand concepts first on your own to better learn.
