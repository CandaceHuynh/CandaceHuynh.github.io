JavaScript Reflection
	JavaScript is a versatile programming language that is primarily used for front-end web development. Some of these front end web applications include: web browsers such as web pages, mobile applications or apps for short, and even simple browser games (ChatGPT, 2024). Because of the unique features in JavaScript, I believe that JavaScript can be beneficial from the software development perspective, particularly in the development of front end applications.  

Although I did not have any prior experience I felt that the logical component of JavaScript is very much like every other programming language and because of this I did not find JavaScript initially challenging. However much like learning new material, the syntax portion of this language feels unfamiliar. With repetition I hope to achieve a decent fluency and deeper understanding of how front end applications can be written in this language by the end of this course. 

	I think the concept of athletic software engineering really conditions and shifts our mindset to think and behave much like a proficient software developer. The nature of WODs, from the time intensity to the complexity of the problem, really pushes us past our comfort zones and increases our tolerance for hardship. I think this style of learning will really benefit us in the long run because this concept is much like physical conditioning. High intensity workouts over a short period of time benefits our mentality greater for tougher situations compared to low intensity workouts.
