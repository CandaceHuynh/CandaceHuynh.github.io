### How did you make your effort estimates?

I kept track of all my coding and non-coding efforts through the world clock app on my phone. Before I would even start thinking aboout my project, I would first take a glance at the time on my phone and take note of it. When I eventually grew tried of thinking about the logistics of my project, I would glance at the time again and take note of it. 

### Even though your estimates were always off, sometimes way off, was there any benefit from making effort estimates for the issues in advance? If so, what benefits? If not, why not?

Although there were some estimates that were off, I think there was actually some benefit from making effort estimates for the issues in advance because it helps us gauge how much time we were suppose to allocate to work on this particular part of the project. If our \"guest-timates\" were off we would adapt and learn to allocate more time or retract time from certain issues of our project in future milestones. 

### Was there any benefit for tracking the actual effort expended on the issues? If so, what benefits? If not, why not?

Yes, I think that there were some benefits to tracking the actual effort expended on the issues because like I said above, if our estimates were off we would adapt and learn to allocate more time or retract time from certain issues of our project in future milestones.

### How did you track your actual effort? How accurate do you believe your tracking was?

I used a timer on my phone and was conscious of the time. Keeping note of it, and checking the time every so often.
