### I. Introduction

Before experiencing the Software Engineering course ICS 314 at the University of Hawaii at Manoa I, just like every other second year programmer that sat in that very same room had surface level thoughts of software development being strictly tied to web applications. Little did I know that the world of software engineering possesses a much larger scope of concepts. Some of these concepts include; open source software; configuration management; functional programming; coding standards; user interface frameworks; agile project management; design patterns; and even ethics surrounding software engineering. Of the many concepts covered through the course, there were a few that really stuck out to me that I think best describes software development in a well rounded fashion. 

### II. Open Source Software Development

As the saying goes, two heads are generally better than one. I believe that this is also true for software development. Open source software development refers to the collaborative process of creating, enhancing, and maintaining software from source code that is made freely available to the public (OpenAI, 2024). This type of software development usually involves a community of developers who each contribute to the code whether it’d be in the means of quality assurance, creative suggestions or reviewing the integrity of the software. Because of the unique attribute of freely available code that everyone and anyone can access, if used correctly this concept can be beneficial in a number of ways from having a set of new eyes to the creativity of different dynamics.

### III. Coding Standards

In my few years of programming, there are a few traits I picked up along the way. While some traits outshine others in certain aspects, I believe the most important characteristic to a good software developer is adequate coding standards. So what exactly are “adequate” coding standards? Well, the answer to that question actually lies on the person reading your code or program. Adequate coding standards should, in my opinion, allow the audience of your code to easily trace and comprehend what your program is doing at all times. Some practices that help convey this might include indenting every new block of code or function, giving some order to the structure of your program, or even commenting short descriptions every few lines of code to give the viewer a sense of what that part of the program is doing. I believe that these standards are the foundation to every good software engineer. 

### IV. Conclusion

In the end, I realized that software engineering had so much more to do with than just designing websites and applications. There is more than what meets the eyes, as behind every application is the intricate planning of structure design, research, and team collaboration.
