### Introduction

If there is anything I have learned in the few years that I have been studying computer science at the University of Hawai’i at Manoa, it would be that having adequate coding standards might be one of the most important traits a good software engineer should have. Although some may disagree with this point of view, here’s a few reasons why I believe that having good coding standards leads to efficient programming. 

### What are coding standards?

Firstly, let’s define what having “adequate coding standards” entails. To some, adequate coding standards might just include the bare minimum of indenting each new line within a block of code giving some order to the structure of your code. To others it may even go as far as commenting on each line of code, giving the next potential viewer of your code some idea as to what function this line presents. However, to me I believe that “adequate coding standards” should include every action taken to ensure that your work is; complex but yet easy to trace and comprehend; uniform in structure; nonrepetitive; and easy to maintain.

### Why are coding standards considered the most important trait of a good software engineer.

The work of a software engineer may sometimes require a structure consisting of multiple layers of codes, each layer dedicated to a specific function that ties nicely together to form a program. Complexity in these programs usually lead to massive blocks of code that can often be confusing to read and trace. In creating nonrepetitive uniform code, viewers including the author can revisit the code and easily backtrack through the thought process behind it. Common practice of adequate coding standards will ultimately lead to efficient programming in the future.
