This project was born out of boredom, I sat there in my calculus class watching my professor explain the different rules and identities of each of the common mathematical functions and their respective derivatives and anti-derivatives. I thought to myself, \"hey, these rules are kind of straight forward maybe I can write them into a code database and calculate the answers to my homework\". 

I spent the next few nights and days furiously clacking away at my laptop, coding my derivative calculator program. Although I still need to run a few more test to ensure I covered all, if not most of the common mathematical functions and their respective differentiation and integration rules.
